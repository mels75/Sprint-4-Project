# Sprint-4-Project
This is my submission for Sprint 4 Project. 
This project analyzes data given to me from car sales advertisements. My goal is to look at the different car models and years and see how this impacts their value. Additionally, I am looking into how the mileage affects their price, and how many of the cars are in stock. 
To analyze the data, I will first preprocess and clean it up for my analysis by checking for duplicates and filling missing values. Afterwards, I use a combination of histograms, scatterplots, and box plots to visualize my data using plotly.express and be able to make assumptions from the graphs. I am using a few different librabies for this analysis, including pandas, plotly.express, numpy, and streamlit. 
For future analysis, if I were to continue analyzing this data, I would perform statistical data analysis to determine if the differences are significant.
In order to access the web app, you would need to visit https://sprint-4-project-ibg7.onrender.com/. Additionally, to run the application you would need a few different librabies for this analysis, including pandas, plotly.express, numpy, and streamlit, which would be needed for anyone to run this project on their local machine.
